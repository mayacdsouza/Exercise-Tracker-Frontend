# Exercise-Tracker-Frontend
React UI for Exercise Tracker

This repository contains the front end code for an exercise tracker I designed in CS290: Web Development. The backend can be viewed here: https://github.com/mayacdsouza/Exercise-Tracker-Backend

Picture of UI:

This tracker allows users to create new exercises, update existing exercises, view created exercises, and delete exercises (the 4 CRUD operations). It was created using the MERN stack.

To run this application....
    1. Clone the front and backend repositories.
    2. Run node install in both repositories to install the necessary node modules.
    3. Create a .env file in the background repository with the following:
        MONGODB_CONNECT_STRING = <connect string to your account>
        PORT = <port number>
    4. Run node start in both repositories to start both servers.
