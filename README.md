# Exercise-Tracker-Frontend
React UI for Exercise Tracker

This repository contains the front end code for an exercise tracker I designed in CS290: Web Development. The backend can be viewed here: https://github.com/mayacdsouza/Exercise-Tracker-Backend

This tracker allows users to create new exercises, update existing exercises, view created exercises, and delete exercises (the 4 CRUD operations). It was created using the MERN stack.
